		<h2>Rolex</h2>
		<p align="justify">Rolex is  the most recognized watch brand in the world with literally 100% brand recognition. But though they are the most famous of all famous watch brands, let's just them for their watchmaking skills not just for their popularity. Rolex produces some rather amazing watches; and lots of them. It is estimated that their production is approximately 2,000 watches per day. One of the things about this most famous watch brand is that people rant and rave about the fact that they have a higher average resale value than any other watch brand on the market. This can directly be attributed to the fact that Rolex is if not the most, certainly one of the most valuable watch brands in the world.</p>


		<h2>Patek Philippe</h2>
		<p align="justify">Known for inventing the very first wristwatch, Patek Philippe & Co has become a top watchmaker and is one of the most sought-after in the world. Everyone would agree that it would be a disservice to make a top 10 list and not mention this watchmaker. Patek Philippe is one of the 3 Holy Trinity Watchmakers. Some of their most popular models include the Nautilus, Aquanaut, World Time, Twenty-4, Calatrava, and more. In addition to their many popular models, Patek Philippe was commissioned to create some of the world's most complicated watches for many high-profile individuals such as James Ward Packard, and Henry Graves. The Graves Supercomplication, one of the most exclusive watches ever made was sold for an astounding $11,000,000 USD in 1999 at a New York auction and featured 24 complications that took 8 years to research and create. Many consider them to be the best watch brand in the world and this is why they were listed first in our top 10 luxury watch brands.</p>


		<h2>TAG Heuer</h2>
		<p align="justify">This watchmaker is one of the more popular brands that has been sensationalized ever since the brand's acquisition by fashion conglomerate LVMH, but their history starts long before that happened. With many watches of their gaining international acclaim such as the iconically square-shaped Monaco that was featured in major films and worn by Hollywood hot-shots. All fashion-world achievements aside, let's focus on the horological trophies that they have accomplished. Such as a high-complication tourbillon-chronograph Chronometer featured below known as the 02T. Their various collections are a good mix of classic watches and racing-themed chronographs, to water-resistant sports models. This watchmaker has been on the up-and-up constantly outdoing themself, and thus, definitely worth mentioning in this list.</p>


		<h2>Glashutte Original</h2>
		<p align="justify">When it comes to high-end watches, people usually think of Switzerland since Swiss watchmakers make up the bulk of the pack. There are exceptions though. Glashutte Original is a Saxonian / German brand which no surprise here, German engineering is world-famous especially when it comes to mechanical engineering.Glash√ºtte Original is one of the few luxury German brands that really stand out. They are arguably one of the most understated in the industry. Their watches have immaculately executed craftsmanship. Their ever-popular Pano series are not just stunning but very well made.

Some of Glashutte Original's most popular collections include the many Senator watches, The Sixties, Seventies, PanoLunar, PanoGraph, PanoMatic as well as a Lady collection which includes the PanoMaticLunar.</p>


		<h2>Omega</h2>
		<p align="justify">Omega SA is one of the more popular brands of luxury watches yet, they are not necessarily one of the most expensive watch brands out there compared to many watchmakers mentioned here. They had their Seamaster watches featured in major films throughout the years; films such as say every James Bond movie since Goldeneye featuring Pierce Brosnan and every "007" film that followed featuring Daniel Craig. Most notably famous for their Moonwatch, the Omega Speedmaster Pro which was on the wrist of Buzz Aldrin as he took his first steps on the lunar surface. Having their watches flight-qualified by NASA for a space mission such as Apollo 11 was instrumental in bringing up the prestige of this brand.
